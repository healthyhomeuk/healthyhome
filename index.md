HealthyHome is a smart device which helps you monitor your indoor environment conditions easily via a mobile application.

During the 21st century we are constantly reminded of how polluted our environment is becoming as a direct consequence of global warming.
A polluted environment, especially an indoors one, poses a risk to the health of humans and stability of buildings.

The aim of HealthyHome is to allow people to quantify important indoor environmental characteristics of their home and help them improve the conditions.
 
The maintainers conceptualised this project after personally experiencing poor health as a result of bad indoor environmental conditions. 
Based on these experiences, they believe it is important that people have access to tools that allow them to characterise their indoor environment.	

Those who re-create this project will have a much more in-depth knowledge of their home environment and can use the information to help them
make important decisions on how improvements can be made to their indoor environments and subsequently their health.

This website will provide an overview of our project and guide you on how to re-create it yourself.
