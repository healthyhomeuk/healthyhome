HealthyHome is a smart device for your house which helps you monitor your indoor environment conditions easily via a mobile application.

During the 21st century we are constatntly remineded of how polluted our environment is becomming as a direct consequence of the
scaling up of many industries. A polluted environment, especially an indoors one, poses a risk to the health of humans and stability 
of their homes.

The aim of HealthyHome is to allow interested parties to quantify important indoor environmental characteristics of their home 
and help them improve their conditions.
 
The maintainers concptualised this project after personally experiencing poor health as a result of bad indoor environmental conditions. 
Based on these experiences, we believe it is important that people have access to tools that allow them to personally characterise their
indoor environment.	

Those who re-create this project will have a much more in-depth knowledge of their home environment and can use the information to help them
make important decisions on how improvements can be made to their indoor environemnts and subsequently their health.

This website will provide an overview of our project and guide you on how to re-recreate it yourself.
